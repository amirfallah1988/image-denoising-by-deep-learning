Denoising Images by deep learning neural networks
In this repository, I have explained an simple image denoising method based on deep neural networks. There was two different scenarios: <br>
1. First one was the classic denoising problem, in which, we have a single noisy image and we want to denosie it. <br>
2. In the second one, there were a sequence of a same image with different noise. So we have to try to extract the original image from sequence of noisy image.<br>
For both scenarios I used deep learning nerual networks with different structrues. Note that both models are simple and I just wanted to show the method and solution. Based on the requirment and resources of your project, you can change number of layers or number of filters in each layer.
