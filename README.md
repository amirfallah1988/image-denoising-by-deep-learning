Denoising Images by deep learning neural networks
In this repository, I have explained a simple image denoising method based on deep neural networks. There was two different scenarios: <br>
<ol><b> 1. First one was the classic denoising problem, in which, we have a single noisy image and we want to denosie it. <br>
2. In the second one, there were a sequence of a same image with different noise. So we have to try to extract the original image from sequence of noisy image.<br></b></ol>
For both scenarios I used deep learning neural networks with different structures. Note that both models are simple and I just wanted to show the method and solution. Based on the requirements and resources of your project, you can change number of layers or number of filters in each layer.<br>
<b> The code is based on python and was written using tensorflow v.2. More information and expalantion of each part of the code can be found inside the notebook. (Note that there are separate notebooks for each scenarios, but to understand them, it is recommended to read them respectively.)
